    "# Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion is a rather old concept in physics. The phenomena was first discovered by Robert Brown in 1827 when he was studying the movement of molecules suspended in a stationary liquid. A formal theory of Brownian motion was developped by [Einstein in 1905](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/teaching/old_literature/Einstein1905.pdf), linking Brownian motion to the kinetic theory of heat dissipation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will build a diffusion model from scratch. \n",
    "To do this, I provide a minimal description of stochastic processes based on\n",
    "Brownian motion, Langevin dynamics, the heat equation and the more general Fokker-Planck equation. \n",
    "I try to keep the theoretical description of diffusion to a minimum to avoid overloading this section with technical \n",
    "concepts. \n",
    "The more general theory that describes Stochastic Differential Equations and It√¥ Calculus are touched upon in a different section for the reader interested in more advanced concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have decided to mute the connection with thermodynamic to some degree. \n",
    "Of course, thermodynamic served as the main inspiration for the invention of diffusion models ([Sohl-Dickstein et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585)). So I might eventually explore this work in a separate section. "

    "Denoising is intimately connected to learning a distribution. This connection is most evident in Tweedie's formula, first reported by [Robbins (1956)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-35/issue-1/The-Empirical-Bayes-Approach-to-Statistical-Decision-Problems/10.1214/aoms/1177703729.full).\n",

    "\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{x}_0 \\mid \\mathbf{x}_t] = \\mathbf{x}_t + \\sigma^2(t) \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_t} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x}_t)\\, .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In other words, the score function is the optimal denoiser at first order. More importantly, this connection between denoising and the score function will allow us to move back and forth between the two pictures to construct a scalable framework for learning distributions from samples in high-dimensional spaces."
